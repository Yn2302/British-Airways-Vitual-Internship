Whether itâ€™s for holidays, work or any other reason, the end-to-end process of scheduling, planning, boarding, fuelling, transporting, landing, and continuously running flights on time, efficiently and with top-class customer service is a huge task with many highly important responsibilities.
As a data scientist at BA, it will be your job to apply your analytical skills to influence real life multi-million-pound decisions from day one, making a tangible impact on the business as your recommendations, tools and models drive key business decisions, reduce costs and increase revenue.
